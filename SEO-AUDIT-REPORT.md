## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUES TO FIX (High Priority)

❌ **No Google My Business Schema** - This is CRITICAL for local SEO
- Need to add Organization schema with Google Business Profile link
- Need to add reviews schema
- Need social media profiles in schema

### 2. **WEAK: Internal Linking Structure**
⚠️ Limited cross-linking between pages
- Homepage → Service pages (basic links exist)
- Service pages → Other service pages (MISSING)
- Location pages → Service pages (MISSING)

### 3. **MISSING: Location-Specific Service Pages**
❌ No combo pages like:

- "Plumber in Richardson"  
- "Smart Home Installation Frisco"
- These would be GOLD for local SEO

### 4. **OUTDATED: SEO Component Schema**
⚠️ Still says "HomeImprovementBusiness" 
- Should be "Electrician" OR "Plumber" as primary type
- Service types still list old services (Kitchen Remodeling, etc.)

### 5. **MISSING: Customer Reviews/Testimonials**
❌ No reviews visible on site
❌ No review schema markup
- Social proof is CRITICAL for conversions

### 6. **WEAK: Title Tags & H1s**
⚠️ Some good, some need optimization:

- Need to add year "2025" for freshness

## 📊 MEDIUM PRIORITY ISSUES

### 7. **Missing Alt Tags on Images**
⚠️ Logo and images need descriptive alt text with keywords
